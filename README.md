A **variable** is a name given to a value stored in memory. Python allows you to create variables without explicitly defining their type.

- **Variable:** A placeholder for storing values in memory.

##### **Common Data Types in Python:**

- **Integer (int):** Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
- **Float (float):** Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
- **String (str):** Text data (e.g., 'Hello', 'Python').
- **Boolean (bool):** True or False values (True, False).
- **List (list):** Ordered collection of values (e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana']).
- **Dictionary (dict):** Key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}).

##### **Example: Creating and Printing Variables**

```python
# Defining variables
age = 25  # Integer
gpa = 3.8  # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean

# Printing values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("GPA:", gpa)
print("Student Status:", is_student)
```

#### **Control Structures**

Control structures allow decision-making and looping through data.

##### **Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)**

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

- **Conditional Statement:** A block of code that executes only if a condition is met.

##### **Loops (for, while)**

```python
# Using a for loop
tools = ["Python", "SQL", "Tableau"]
for tool in tools:
    print("I use", tool)

# Using a while loop
count = 3
while count > 0:
    print("Countdown:", count)
    count -= 1
```

- **Loop:** A structure that repeats code multiple times based on a condition.

#### **Functions in Python**

A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

##### **Example: Defining and Calling Functions**

```python
def greet(name):
    """Function to greet a person."""
    print("Hello,", name)

# Calling the function
greet("Alice")
```

- **Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

- Each coefficient represents the effect of a specific variable on the target variable, assuming other variables remain constant.

#### **Why Use Multiple Linear Regression?**

- Helps in modeling relationships with multiple influencing factors.
- Useful in business, economics, and various data-driven industries.
- Accounts for multiple factors simultaneously, leading to better predictions.

##### **Handling Multiple Features in Python**

```python
# Sample dataset with multiple features
data = {'Feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
         'Feature2': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
         'Target': [5, 9, 13, 17, 21]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting data
X = df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']]
y = df['Target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Model coefficients
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
```

#### **Interpreting Coefficients**

- **Intercept (\( b_0 \)):** The value of \( y \) when all independent variables are zero.
- **Coefficients (\( b_1, b_2, \ldots \)):** The change in \( y \) for a unit change in each independent variable, assuming others remain constant.
- **Feature Importance:** Higher absolute coefficient values indicate stronger influence on the target variable.

- **Notes for Variables:**
  - `X`: Feature matrix containing multiple independent variables.
  - `y`: Target variable.
  - `model.intercept_`: Stores the intercept value.
  - `model.coef_`: Stores the coefficients for independent variables.
  - `y_pred`: Stores predicted values for the test set.

## **Chapter 7: Model Evaluation and Validation**

### **7.1 Evaluation Metrics**

Evaluating a regression model's performance is crucial for understanding how well it generalizes to unseen data. Various metrics help quantify errors and model accuracy.

#### **Key Evaluation Metrics:**

##### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

MSE measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower values indicate better model performance.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

- **Note:** `mean_squared_error()` computes the MSE by averaging the squared errors.

##### **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

RMSE is the square root of MSE and gives error magnitude in the same unit as the target variable.

```python
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse)
```

- **Note:** RMSE is more interpretable since it's in the same unit as the dependent variable.

##### **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

MAE calculates the average absolute differences between actual and predicted values, making it more resistant to outliers than MSE.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
```

- **Note:** `mean_absolute_error()` avoids squaring differences, making it more robust to extreme errors.

##### **R-squared (\( R^2 \)) and Adjusted R-squared**

\( R^2 \) measures how much variation in the dependent variable is explained by independent variables.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("R-squared:", r2)
```

- **Note:** \( R^2 \) ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better model fit.

Adjusted \( R^2 \) accounts for the number of predictors in the model:

```python
n = len(y_test)  # Number of observations
p = X_test.shape[1]  # Number of predictors
adj_r2 = 1 - ((1 - r2) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1))
print("Adjusted R-squared:", adj_r2)
```

- **Note:** Adjusted \( R^2 \) penalizes additional variables that do not improve model performance.

---

### **7.2 Cross-Validation**

Cross-validation ensures a model performs well on unseen data by splitting data into multiple subsets.

#### **K-fold Cross-Validation**

K-fold cross-validation splits data into K equal parts, using each as a test set once.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2')
print("Cross-Validation R² Scores:", scores)
print("Mean R² Score:", scores.mean())
```

- **Note:** `cv=5` means data is split into five folds for validation.

#### **Stratified Sampling**

Stratified sampling ensures proportional representation of categories in training and testing data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```

- **Note:** `StratifiedKFold()` maintains class balance across folds.

---

### **7.3 Overfitting and Underfitting**

A well-performing model balances bias and variance.

#### **Identifying Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Overfitting:** Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
- **Underfitting:** Model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.

#### **Regularization Techniques**

Regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing complex models.

##### **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

Adds a penalty to large coefficients to reduce model complexity.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** `alpha` controls the penalty strength; higher values reduce complexity more.

##### **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

Lasso regression can shrink some coefficients to zero, acting as a feature selector.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

lasso_model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** Lasso is useful when many independent variables are irrelevant.

##### **Elastic Net (Combination of L1 and L2)**

Elastic Net combines Ridge and Lasso penalties.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet

elastic_model = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
elastic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** `l1_ratio` controls the mix of L1 and L2 regularization.

---

This chapter covered key evaluation metrics, cross-validation techniques, and methods to combat overfitting and underfitting. The next chapter will dive into feature selection and optimization for improving model performance.

---

## **Chapter 8: Advanced Regression Techniques**

### **8.1 Polynomial Regression**

#### **Fitting Nonlinear Relationships**

Polynomial regression extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to capture nonlinear relationships in data. The equation for a second-degree polynomial regression is:  
\[ y = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 \]  
where higher-degree terms model curvature in the data.

##### **Implementing Polynomial Regression in Python**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# Generating sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66])

# Creating a polynomial regression model
poly_model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree=2), LinearRegression())
poly_model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = poly_model.predict(X)

# Plotting results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Polynomial Regression Line')
plt.xlabel("Feature")
plt.ylabel("Target")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Polynomial Regression")
plt.show()
```

- **Notes for Variables:**
  - `PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)`: Generates squared terms for polynomial regression.
  - `make_pipeline()`: Creates a sequential model combining transformations and regression.
  - `fit()`: Trains the model using polynomial features.
  - `predict()`: Generates predictions using the trained model.

#### **Overfitting in Polynomial Regression**

Higher-degree polynomials can fit training data too closely, leading to overfitting. To prevent this:

- Use cross-validation to test generalizability.
- Choose an optimal degree using validation data.

---

### **8.2 Regularization Techniques**

Regularization reduces overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in regression models.

#### **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

Ridge regression adds an L2 penalty to minimize large coefficient values.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** `alpha` controls the penalty; higher values shrink coefficients more.

#### **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

Lasso regression adds an L1 penalty, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting important features.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

lasso_model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** Lasso is useful when many independent variables are irrelevant.

#### **Elastic Net (Combination of L1 and L2)**

Elastic Net blends Ridge and Lasso penalties, balancing feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet

elastic_model = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
elastic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Note:** `l1_ratio` controls the mix of L1 and L2 regularization.

---

### **8.3 Logistic Regression**

#### **Binary and Multinomial Classification**

Logistic regression is used for classification problems where the target variable is categorical. The logistic function is defined as:  
\[ P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n)}} \]  
where \( P(Y=1) \) is the probability of the target being in class 1.

#### **Sigmoid Function and Odds Ratio**

- The **sigmoid function** transforms outputs into probabilities between 0 and 1.
- The **odds ratio** represents the likelihood of an event occurring.

##### **Implementing Logistic Regression in Python**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample binary classification dataset
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating and training the model
log_model = LogisticRegression()
log_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
y_pred = log_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating model accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

- **Notes for Variables:**
  - `LogisticRegression()`: Creates a logistic regression model.
  - `fit()`: Trains the model on binary classification data.
  - `predict()`: Predicts class labels for test data.
  - `accuracy_score()`: Measures how well predictions match actual values.

---

This chapter introduced advanced regression techniques, including polynomial regression for nonlinear relationships, regularization for preventing overfitting, and logistic regression for classification problems. The next chapter will explore feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for improving model performance.

---

## **Chapter 9: Feature Engineering and Selection**

### **9.1 Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning models. Effective feature engineering can significantly impact a model's predictive power by allowing models to learn better patterns from the data.

#### **Creating New Features**

Creating new features from existing data can help capture hidden patterns and improve model accuracy. This is an essential step when working with complex datasets where raw attributes may not fully represent underlying trends.

- **Polynomial Features:** Generating new features by raising existing ones to a power (e.g., \( x^2 \), \( x^3 \)). This can help capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Interaction Features:** Creating features by combining two or more existing ones (e.g., multiplying or adding them together). This can enhance the model's ability to identify interactions between variables.
- **Log Transformations:** Applying a logarithmic transformation to normalize skewed data. This is particularly useful when dealing with variables that exhibit exponential growth.
- **Binning:** Grouping continuous variables into discrete categories to capture trends more effectively.
- **Extracting Date/Time Components:** Extracting components such as day, month, hour, or day of the week from a datetime variable to uncover patterns based on time.

- **Note:** Feature Engineering is the process of creating new input features from existing data to enhance predictive modeling.

#### **Handling Categorical Variables**

Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical formats before they can be used in machine learning models. There are several techniques for encoding categorical data:

##### **One-Hot Encoding**

This method creates a new binary column for each category, ensuring that categorical data is represented in a way that avoids ordinal misinterpretation.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({'Color': ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Red']})
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse_output=False)
encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(data[['Color']])
print(encoded_data)
```

- **Library Used:** pandas for data manipulation, `sklearn.preprocessing` for one-hot encoding.

##### **Label Encoding**

Assigns a unique integer to each category, useful for ordinal variables but can introduce unintended ordinal relationships for nominal variables.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['Color_encoded'] = encoder.fit_transform(data['Color'])
print(data)
```

- **Library Used:** `sklearn.preprocessing` for label encoding.

- **Note:** One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding are common techniques for handling categorical variables.

---

### **9.2 Feature Selection**

Feature selection involves identifying and retaining the most relevant features for a machine learning model while eliminating redundant or irrelevant ones. This helps in reducing overfitting, improving model interpretability, and decreasing computational cost.

#### **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**

RFE is an iterative approach that selects the best features by recursively removing the least important ones based on model coefficients.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, random_state=42)
model = LogisticRegression()
rfe = RFE(model, n_features_to_select=5)
X_selected = rfe.fit_transform(X, y)
print(rfe.support_)
```

- **Library Used:** `sklearn.feature_selection` for RFE, `sklearn.linear_model` for logistic regression, `sklearn.datasets` for sample data.

- **Note:** Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a method that recursively removes the least important features.

#### **Using Lasso for Feature Selection**

Lasso regression (L1 regularization) shrinks some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting only the most significant features and eliminating less important ones.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X, y)
print(lasso.coef_)
```

- **Library Used:** `sklearn.linear_model` for Lasso regression.

- **Note:** Lasso Regression applies L1 regularization, shrinking some coefficients to zero.

---

### **9.3 Dimensionality Reduction**

Dimensionality reduction techniques help reduce the number of features while preserving essential information, making models more efficient and reducing overfitting.

#### **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

PCA is a linear technique that transforms data into a set of orthogonal components that explain the maximum variance in the dataset. It is useful for reducing dimensionality while retaining most of the information.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)
print(X_pca[:5])
```

- **Library Used:** `sklearn.decomposition` for PCA.

- **Note:** PCA is a statistical method that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space by maximizing variance.

#### **t-SNE and UMAP**

##### **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**

A non-linear dimensionality reduction technique particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It preserves local structure but struggles with global structure.

```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X)
print(X_tsne[:5])
```

- **Library Used:** `sklearn.manifold` for t-SNE.

##### **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**

Another powerful technique for non-linear dimensionality reduction, UMAP is faster and better at preserving global structure compared to t-SNE. It is useful for visualization as well as feature reduction for machine learning tasks.

```python
import umap

umap_reducer = umap.UMAP(n_components=2)
X_umap = umap_reducer.fit_transform(X)
print(X_umap[:5])
```

- **Library Used:** `umap` for dimensionality reduction.

- **Note:** t-SNE and UMAP are techniques for non-linear dimensionality reduction.

#### **Difference Between t-SNE and UMAP**

| **Feature**            | **t-SNE**           | **UMAP**           |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Speed**              | Slower, computationally expensive | Faster and more scalable |
| **Preserves Global Structure** | Poor at capturing global structure | Better at preserving both global and local structures |
| **Interpretability**   | Mainly used for visualization | Can be used for both visualization and clustering |
| **Dimensionality**     | Works well for 2D and 3D visualization | Scales well to higher dimensions |
| **Usage**              | Often used for exploratory data analysis | Suitable for embedding high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for machine learning |

- **Note:** t-SNE is ideal for visualization, while UMAP is scalable and preserves more structure.

---

## **Chapter 10: Time Series Regression**

### **10.1 Introduction to Time Series**

Time series data is a sequence of observations recorded over time at regular intervals. Time series regression is a statistical technique used to model relationships between time-dependent variables. Unlike traditional regression models, time series regression accounts for temporal structures such as trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.

#### **Components of Time Series**

A time series typically consists of the following components:

- **Trend:** A long-term upward or downward movement in the data.
- **Seasonality:** A repeating pattern observed at fixed intervals, such as daily, weekly, or yearly fluctuations.
- **Cyclical Patterns:** Long-term patterns that occur over an irregular period due to economic or business cycles.
- **Noise (Irregular Component):** Random fluctuations that do not follow a pattern.

Understanding these components is crucial for building accurate predictive models.

- **Note:** Time series data consists of patterns such as trend, seasonality, cycles, and random noise.

---

### **10.2 Autoregressive Models**

Autoregressive (AR) models use past values of a time series to predict future values. These models assume that past observations influence future observations in a systematic way.

#### **AR (Autoregressive) Model**

The AR model predicts the next value based on a linear combination of previous values:  
\[ Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \ldots + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t \]  
where:

- \( Y_t \) is the time series value at time \( t \).
- \( c \) is a constant.
- \( \phi_p \) are lag coefficients.
- \( \epsilon_t \) is white noise.

#### **MA (Moving Average) Model**

The MA model uses past error terms instead of past values:  
\[ Y_t = \mu + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \ldots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t \]  
where:

- \( \mu \) is the mean of the series.
- \( \theta_q \) are moving average coefficients.
- \( \epsilon_t \) is white noise.

#### **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Model**

The ARIMA model combines AR and MA models with differencing to remove trends:  
\[ Y_t' = Y_t - Y_{t-1} \]  
This transformation makes the series stationary before applying AR or MA components.

#### **Handling Seasonality and Trends**

Seasonality can be handled by including seasonal differences in the ARIMA model (SARIMA). Trends can be removed using differencing, polynomial regression, or decomposition techniques.

- **Note:** AR, MA, and ARIMA models predict future values based on past observations and error terms, making them powerful tools for time series forecasting.

---

### **10.3 Time Series Regression in Python**

#### **Using Statsmodels for Time Series Analysis**

`statsmodels` provides tools for time series modeling, including AR, MA, and ARIMA models.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Generate synthetic time series data
dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')
data = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100))
df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Value': data})
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(df['Value'], order=(2,1,2))
model_fit = model.fit()
print(model_fit.summary())
```

- **Library Used:** `statsmodels` for ARIMA modeling, `pandas` for data handling, `numpy` for generating synthetic data.

#### **Using Scikit-Learn for Time Series Regression**

Scikit-learn can be used for time series regression by transforming time features into a supervised learning problem.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create lag features
df['Lag_1'] = df['Value'].shift(1)
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Split data into train and test sets
X = df[['Lag_1']]
y = df['Value']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Train linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict future values
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred[:5])
```

- **Library Used:** `scikit-learn` for regression modeling, `pandas` for feature engineering.

#### **Comparing Time Series Models**

| **Model**        | **Strengths**                | **Limitations**                |
|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **AR**           | Simple, interpretable        | Assumes linear dependence      |
| **MA**           | Handles random fluctuations  | Sensitive to noise             |
| **ARIMA**        | Powerful for forecasting     | Requires stationarity          |
| **Linear Regression** | Can incorporate external factors | Ignores time dependence        |

- **Note:** Time series models should be selected based on data properties such as stationarity, seasonality, and autocorrelation.

---

## **Chapter 11: Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**

### **11.1 Introduction to GLM**

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) extend linear regression by allowing for response variables that follow different probability distributions, rather than just assuming normally distributed errors. This makes GLMs useful for modeling count data, binary outcomes, and other non-Gaussian distributions.

#### **Components of a GLM:**

1. **Random Component:** Defines the distribution of the response variable (e.g., Normal, Poisson, Gamma).
2. **Systematic Component:** A linear predictor that combines independent variables.
3. **Link Function:** A transformation that connects the mean of the response variable to the linear predictor.

GLMs are widely used in fields such as epidemiology, insurance risk modeling, and econometrics.

- **Note:** Generalized Linear Models extend linear regression by using different probability distributions and link functions.

---

### **11.2 Types of GLM**

#### **Poisson Regression**

Poisson regression is used for modeling count data where the response variable represents event occurrences over a fixed interval (e.g., number of customer visits per day). It assumes that the response variable follows a Poisson distribution:  
\[ P(Y = y) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^y}{y!} \]  
where \( \lambda \) is the expected count.

- **Link Function:** Log function (ensures positive values for counts).
- **Example Use Case:** Predicting the number of insurance claims based on policyholder characteristics.

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'claims': [2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 3, 0],  # Number of claims
    'age': [25, 30, 45, 50, 35, 40, 55, 60, 29, 33],  # Age of policyholder
    'exposure': [1, 0.8, 0.9, 1.2, 1, 1, 1.1, 1.3, 0.7, 0.8]  # Exposure factor
})

# Fit Poisson regression model
model = smf.glm(formula='claims ~ age + exposure', data=data, family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

- **Libraries Used:** `pandas` for data handling, `statsmodels.api` for GLM modeling, `statsmodels.formula.api` for formula-based modeling.

- **Note:** Poisson regression is effective for modeling count data with non-negative integer responses.

---

#### **Gamma Regression**

Gamma regression is useful when modeling continuous positive data with skewed distributions, such as insurance claims amounts or waiting times.

- **Link Function:** Inverse function (ensures positivity).
- **Example Use Case:** Predicting insurance claim amounts based on age and exposure.

```python
# Fit Gamma regression model
model_gamma = smf.glm(formula='claims ~ age + exposure', data=data, family=sm.families.Gamma()).fit()
print(model_gamma.summary())
```

- **Libraries Used:** `pandas` for data handling, `statsmodels.api` for GLM modeling, `statsmodels.formula.api` for formula-based modeling.

- **Note:** Gamma regression is useful for modeling skewed, continuous positive values.

---

### **11.3 Implementing GLM in Python**

GLMs are implemented in Python using the `statsmodels` library, which provides robust methods for fitting and evaluating these models.

#### **Steps to Implement GLM:**

1. **Load the dataset:** Ensure data is in a structured format.
2. **Select the GLM family:** Choose Poisson, Gamma, or another distribution.
3. **Specify the model formula:** Define the relationship between the response and independent variables.
4. **Fit the model:** Estimate parameters using maximum likelihood estimation.
5. **Interpret results:** Analyze coefficients, p-values, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

```python
# Display model coefficients
print(model.params)

# Predict new values
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'age': [40, 50], 'exposure': [1.1, 1.2]})
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
```

- **Variables Used:**
  - `claims`: The dependent variable representing counts (for Poisson) or continuous values (for Gamma).
  - `age`: An independent variable affecting the response.
  - `exposure`: A factor adjusting for different observation periods.

- **Tools Used:**
  - `statsmodels.api`: For GLM modeling.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.

- **Note:** GLMs provide flexibility by allowing different response distributions and link functions.

---

#### **Summary of GLM Types:**

| **GLM Type**    | **Response Variable** | **Link Function** | **Example Use Case** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Poisson Regression** | Count Data         | Log          | Predicting number of claims |
| **Gamma Regression** | Continuous Positive Data | Inverse      | Predicting insurance claim amounts |

- **Final Note:** Generalized Linear Models extend linear regression to a broader range of distributions, making them essential for diverse predictive modeling tasks.

---

## **Chapter 12: Bayesian Regression**

### **12.1 Introduction to Bayesian Statistics**

Bayesian regression is a probabilistic approach to regression analysis that incorporates prior knowledge into the modeling process. Unlike frequentist regression, which estimates a single best-fit line, Bayesian regression provides a distribution over possible regression parameters, allowing for better uncertainty quantification.

#### **Bayes' Theorem**

Bayesian statistics is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes how prior beliefs are updated in light of new evidence:  
\[ P(\theta \| D) = \frac{P(D \| \theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)} \]  
where:

- \( P(\theta \| D) \) is the posterior probability of the parameters given the data.
- \( P(D \| \theta) \) is the likelihood of the data given the parameters.
- \( P(\theta) \) is the prior probability of the parameters.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal likelihood (a normalizing constant).

By combining prior information with observed data, Bayesian regression produces a probability distribution over regression parameters rather than a single deterministic estimate.

- **Note:** Bayesian regression allows for more robust predictions by incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty.

---

### **12.2 Bayesian Linear Regression**

Bayesian linear regression extends traditional linear regression by treating regression coefficients as probability distributions rather than fixed values. Instead of estimating a single set of parameters, it models a posterior distribution over them.

#### **Model Formulation**

A standard linear regression model is given by:  
\[ y = X\beta + \epsilon \]  
where:

- \( y \) is the response variable.
- \( X \) is the matrix of predictor variables.
- \( \beta \) is the vector of regression coefficients.
- \( \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \) is normally distributed noise.

In Bayesian regression, we assume a prior distribution over \( \beta \), typically a Gaussian distribution:  
\[ \beta \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I) \]  
This prior assumption allows us to incorporate domain knowledge or impose constraints (e.g., enforcing sparsity).

#### **Implementing Bayesian Linear Regression in Python**

We use **PyMC3** to implement Bayesian linear regression. PyMC3 is a probabilistic programming library that enables easy specification and sampling from Bayesian models.

##### **Example: Bayesian Linear Regression with PyMC3**

```python
import pymc3 as pm
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 3 * X + np.random.normal(0, 2, size=100)

# Bayesian Regression Model
with pm.Model() as model:
    beta = pm.Normal("beta", mu=0, sigma=10)
    alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", mu=0, sigma=10)
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal("sigma", sigma=1)
    mu = alpha + beta * X
    y_obs = pm.Normal("y_obs", mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=y)
    trace = pm.sample(1000, return_inferencedata=True)

# Plot the posterior distribution of beta
pm.plot_posterior(trace, var_names=["beta"])
plt.show()
```

- **Libraries Used:** `pymc3` for Bayesian modeling, `numpy` for data generation, `matplotlib` for visualization.

- **Variables Used:**
  - `X`: Predictor variable.
  - `y`: Response variable.
  - `beta`: Regression coefficient (slope) modeled as a normal distribution.
  - `alpha`: Intercept modeled as a normal distribution.
  - `sigma`: Standard deviation of noise, modeled as a half-normal distribution.
  - `trace`: Collection of sampled parameter values from the posterior distribution.

- **Note:** Bayesian regression produces a distribution over regression parameters instead of point estimates, enabling uncertainty quantification.

---

### **12.3 Advantages of Bayesian Regression**

Bayesian regression provides several benefits over traditional regression methods:

1. **Uncertainty Quantification:**
   - Instead of providing a single estimate for parameters, Bayesian regression generates a distribution, allowing for direct uncertainty estimation.
   - Confidence intervals can be computed from the posterior distribution.

2. **Incorporation of Prior Knowledge:**
   - Prior distributions enable the incorporation of domain expertise.
   - Can regularize models naturally, reducing overfitting.

3. **Better Handling of Small Datasets:**
   - Works well in low-data regimes by leveraging prior information.
   - Helps prevent overfitting when training data is limited.

4. **Flexibility in Model Specification:**
   - Can model complex relationships using hierarchical structures.
   - Easily extends to non-linear and non-Gaussian models.

#### **Summary Table: Bayesian vs. Frequentist Regression**

| **Feature**         | **Bayesian Regression**   | **Frequentist Regression** |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Parameter Estimation** | Probability distributions over parameters | Point estimates |
| **Uncertainty Quantification** | Directly available from posterior distributions | Requires bootstrapping or confidence intervals |
| **Prior Knowledge Incorporation** | Uses prior distributions | No prior knowledge used |
| **Handling of Small Data** | Performs well due to priors | May overfit or underfit |
| **Flexibility**     | Easily extends to complex models | Limited to predefined forms |

- **Note:** Bayesian regression is particularly useful when dealing with small datasets, incorporating prior information, and quantifying uncertainty.

### **Appendix B: Mathematical Foundations (Chapters 4, 5, 7, 8, 12)**

Understanding the mathematical principles behind regression modeling is essential for interpreting results and improving models.

#### **Linear Regression Equation**

The linear regression model is represented as:  
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon \]  
where:

- \( Y \) is the dependent variable,
- \( X_i \) are the independent variables,
- \( \beta_i \) are the coefficients,
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

#### **Cost Function (Mean Squared Error)**

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures model accuracy:  
\[ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 \]  
where:

- \( Y_i \) is the actual value,
- \( \hat{Y}_i \) is the predicted value,
- \( n \) is the number of observations.

#### **Gradient Descent for Optimization**

Gradient descent updates model parameters iteratively:  
\[ \beta_j = \beta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta_j} \]  
where:

- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate,
- \( J \) is the cost function.

#### **Regularization Techniques**

##### **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

Adds a penalty to the regression coefficients:  
\[ J(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2 \]  
where \( \lambda \) controls regularization strength.

##### **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

Encourages sparsity in model coefficients:  
\[ J(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j| \]

#### **Bayesian Regression**

In Bayesian regression, parameters are treated as probability distributions:  
\[ P(\beta \| X, Y) \propto P(Y \| X, \beta) P(\beta) \]  
where:

- \( P(\beta \| X, Y) \) is the posterior distribution,
- \( P(Y \| X, \beta) \) is the likelihood,
- \( P(\beta) \) is the prior distribution.

- **Note:** A solid mathematical foundation enhances understanding and optimization of regression models.
